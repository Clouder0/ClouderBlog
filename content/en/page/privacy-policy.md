This website(Clouder's Blog) is generated by Hugo as a static site. As a consequence, **I** won't collect any data from you.

However, the website is integrated with some third-party services that may collect your information. Below is the list of them.

## Third Party Services

### Google Analytics

Google Analytics is used to collect visitors' information to help me better organize my content.

What it will collect from you:

- Pageviews

- Scrolls

- Outbound clicks

- Site search

- File downloads

- Location(based on IP address)

I've enabled `respectDoNotTrack` in Hugo config so that it will respect your *DoNotTrack* tag. Also, `anonymizeIP` is enabled.

Ad personalization has been disabled in all regions.

For detailed information, please read [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

### Utterances

Utterances is a lightweight comments widget built on GitHub Issues. It acts as the comment widget in my blog.

It is an open-source project which promises no tracking. But you have to use your Github account when replying and this may leak your personal information.

For detailed information, please see [Utterances Github Repo](https://github.com/utterance/utterances).

As an individual blogger, I have no appetite for your data.

If you are concerned about your privacy, feel free to use a tracker blocker.
