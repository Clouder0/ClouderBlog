> Where the Cloud is? Mildly it escapes.

For more information, please visit my [portfolio website](https://about.codein.icu/).

My biolink: [https://bio.link/clouder](https://bio.link/clouder).

I am Clouder, a student major in CS(Computer Science) who enjoys tech & life.

In high school years, I had been a competitive programmer for about 2 years and now have quitted.

As I've been using Siyuan Note as my PKM(Personal Knowledge Management) tool to hold all my information, this website only contains some selected articles.

While the majority of the articles are only available in Chinese, some articles are translated into English or even originally written in English for global access.
